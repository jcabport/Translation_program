Novel Translation Website Concept
I love your idea of using Claude 3.7 for novel translation! You've identified the key problem with consistency across chapters when context windows are limited. Let me outline a solution and add some improvements.
Core Architecture

Translation Engine

Claude API integration for high-quality translation
Batch processing for chapter-by-chapter translation


Name Management System

Persistent dictionary of proper nouns (character names, locations, etc.)
First-appearance detection and user prompting
Global consistency enforcement


User Interface

Novel/chapter management
Translation review
Name decision interface



Technical Implementation
Let me design a React-based frontend with a Node.js backend:Novel Translation System ArchitectureClick to open diagramTap to openKey Features & Improvements

Smart Name Detection

Use NLP techniques to identify potential proper nouns in the source text
Track frequency and context to distinguish names from common words
Pre-populate with common naming patterns for Korean/Japanese novels


Context Preservation

Store chapter summaries with each translation to provide additional context for future chapters
Include a "key terms" section that carries forward to maintain consistency


User-Assisted Learning

Build a feedback system where users can correct translations
Learn from corrections to improve future translations


Translation Memory

Store sentence/paragraph pairs to reuse similar translations
Reduce API costs and improve consistency


Collaborative Name Dictionary

Allow community-sourced dictionaries for popular series
Import/export functionality for name mappings



Let me draft some code snippets for key components:Name Management ServiceClick to open codeTap to openTranslation ServiceClick to open codeTap to openName Resolution ComponentClick to open codeTap to openAdditional Improvements to Consider

Progressive Translation

Translate chapters in smaller chunks and stitch them together
Reduces token usage and improves throughput


Parallel Processing

Process multiple chapters simultaneously
Implement a job queue for batch processing


Translation Memory

Store translated segments (sentences/paragraphs)
Reuse for similar text to improve consistency and reduce API costs


Export Options

EPUB generation
PDF export
Reading mode interface


Interactive Glossary

Clickable terms that show definitions/context
Cultural notes for specific references


Offline Mode

Download translated chapters for offline reading
Sync dictionary updates when back online


Privacy Considerations

Encrypt stored novels
Implement user authentication
Consider GDPR compliance for user data



Implementation Challenges

API Rate Limiting

Implement queuing system for translations
Batch process during off-peak hours


Name Detection Accuracy

May need fine-tuning based on language specifics
Consider supervised learning from user corrections


Cost Management

Cache translations to reduce API calls
Implement usage limits or subscription tiers



Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this system? Or would you prefer to see a more detailed implementation of any particular component?
